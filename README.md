# Movie-Recommender-System

This is a basic Machine Learning project for my course.

You don't need to install any IDE to run this project. You can basically use jupyter notebook in your web browser.

But you need to load the data. The 2 data have to be in the same file.

After installation run all models in order and type the movie name into the recommend function. (The function is key sensitive. Be careful.)
